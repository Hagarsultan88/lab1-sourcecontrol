1.Purpose of a Git respository:
Stores project code history, enables version control, collaboration,and rollback for front-end projects.

2.Tracked VS untracked files:
Tracked: monitired by Git (committed or staged).
untracked: new/ignored files not monitored.

Issues: untracked files may cause missing dependencies or inconsistent project builds.

3.Ignoring files(e.g., node_modules):
Prevent large, unnecessary, or machine-specific files from bloating the repo and causing conflicts.

4.Viewing project history:
Helps track changes, debug issues, revert mistakes, and understand how a webpage evolved.

5.Role of GitHub + GitHub Pages:
GitHub hosts code remotely for collaboration, backup, and sharing.
GitHub Pages makes the project live via a URL, adding easy testing and showcasing value for developers.
